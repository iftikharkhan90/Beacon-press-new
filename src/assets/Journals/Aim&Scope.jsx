      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Beacons Press</strong> deals with plant (or other photoautotrophs, such as algae, cyanobacteria and lichens)
        responses to abiotic and biotic stress factors that can result in limited growth and productivity.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Such responses can be analyzed and described at a physiological, biochemical and molecular level. Experimental
        approaches/technologies aiming to improve growth and productivity with a potential for downstream validation
        under stress conditions will also be considered.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Both fundamental and applied research manuscripts are welcome, provided that clear mechanistic hypotheses are
        made and descriptive approaches are avoided. In addition, high-quality review articles will also be considered,
        provided they follow a critical approach and stimulate thought for future research avenues.
